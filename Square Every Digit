Descriptions

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 9^2 is 81 and 1^2 is 1.
Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

Solution #1

def square_digits(num):
    ret = ""
    for x in str(num):
        ret += str(int(x)**2)
    return int(ret)
    
Solution #2

def square_digits(num):
    return int(''.join(str(int(d)**2) for d in str(num)))
    
My solution

def square_digits(num):
    return int(''.join(map(str, [int(i)**2 for i in str(num)])))
