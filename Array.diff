Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

Solution #1

def array_diff(a, b):
    return [x for x in a if x not in b]
    
Solution #2

def array_diff(a, b):
    #your code here
    return filter(lambda i: i not in b, a)

My Solution

def array_diff(a, b):
    if not b:
        return a
    else:
        c = []
        for i in a:
            if i not in b:
                c.append(i)
        return c
